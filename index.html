			<p>
			The CKCyberPack is a FIRST Robotics Competition team located in Chatham-Kent, Ontario.
			Our First Robotics Competition (FRC) team number is 5689 and our FRC rookie year was in 2015. During this year we had competed at the Windsor-Essex Great Lakes Regional competition.
			Our team is currently comprised of around 30 students and are we are very graciously supported by many parents and mentors who dedicated countless hours to this program.
			</p>
			<p>
			Unlike many FRC teams which are formed in a single high school, 
			our team is open to all high schools within Chatham-Kent and our current students and mentors come from several towns throughout the municipality including 
			Chatham, Blenheim, Wallaceburg, and Erieau.
			We currently meet at a central location within St. Clair College's Thames Campus.
			</p>
			<p>
			In our first year of competition we won the FRC Rookie All-Star Award at the Windsor-Essex Great Lakes Regional.
			We were awarded the All-Star Award due to our dedication to our practice and our ingenuity.
			This award granted us with the ability to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition World Championship in St. Louis, Missouri.
			</p>
			<p>
			Since then we have continued on our adventure as a team and have competed at the Windsor-Essex Great Lakes Regional in 2016, 
			the Windsor-Essex Great Lakes District Event in 2017 and the Waterloo District Event in 2017.
			As well as hold many fundraising events around our community to raise funds, awareness of FRC and it's core values.
