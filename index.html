			Idle No More is a largely supported activist group protesting Canadian law bill #C-45, the jobs and growth act. 
			Founded by: Jessica Gordon, Slyvia McAdam, Sheelah McLean, and Nina Wilson; 
			this group of individuals started by directly exchanging emails which eventually led to the startup of their Facebook group “Idle No More”.

			<h1>Impact on the public/government</h1>
			<p>
			The Idle No More movement has increased the public’s awareness of indigenous communities issues both in Canada and internationally. 
			Nearly every indigenous community that has heard of the movement joins the movement hoping with a larger group their voices will be heard better. 
			The movement also organizes and hosts many peaceful rallies and round dances. 
			One of their largest events took place on January 28th, 2013. It consisted of 50 separate events that took place internationally. 
			The media publicized the event and gained the movement even more recognition and support, leading to a meeting with Stephan Harper.
			</p>
			<h2>Meeting With Stephan Harper</h2>

			<p>
			Idle No More managed to have a meeting with former prime minister Stephan Harper after protesting in front of parliament for a month. 
			To attract the attention of the media the protest’s elder went on a 28 day long liquid only diet, eating absolutely nothing. 
			When the media heard of a protest involving indigenous rights they publicized the event 
			and forced the government to issue a meeting from the resulting outrage of the public. 
			The Idle No More group requested that the government allocate some of their resources to addressing indigenous issues such as: 
			poverty, land claims, and profits from natural resources. 
			Each of these requests were met with denial. 
			Idle No More has since tried to get more meetings with the current prime minister with addressing these issues, and they did. 
			But over half of the agreed upon terms have not been met.
